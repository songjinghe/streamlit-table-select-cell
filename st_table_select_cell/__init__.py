# Declare a Streamlit component. `declare_component` returns a function
# that is used to create instances of the component. We're naming this
# function "_component_func", with an underscore prefix, because we don't want
# to expose it directly to users. Instead, we will create a custom wrapper
# function, below, that will serve as our component's public API.

# It's worth noting that this call to `declare_component` is the
# *only thing* you need to do to create the binding between Streamlit and
# your component frontend. Everything else we do in this file is simply a
# best practice.

    # build directory:

# Create a wrapper function for the component. This is an optional
# best practice - we could simply expose the component function returned by
# `declare_component` and call it done. The wrapper allows us to customize
# our component's API: we can pre-process its input args, post-process its
# output value, and add a docstring for users.
def st_table_select_cell(data):
    """Create a new instance of "table_select_cell".

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: pandas DataFrame
        The data table we want to show and interact (select one of its cells). 
        The component will display a table of ${data} with column headers
    key: str or None
        An optional key that uniquely identifies this component. If this is
        None, and the component's arguments are changed, the component will
        be re-mounted in the Streamlit frontend and lose its current state.

    Returns
    -------
    dict|bool
        if not select any cell, return False.
        if select a cell, will return a dict: {'rowId': 'a str of the row id', 'colIndex': 2}
        some typical use case:
        1. data.columns[colIndex], return column name of the selected cell.
        2. data.iloc[int(rowId)].to_dict(), return row of the selected cell as dict.
        3. data.iat[int(rowId), colIndex], return cell content as string.

    """
    # Call through to our private component function. Arguments we pass here
    # will be sent to the frontend, where they'll be available in an "args"
    # dictionary.
    #
    # "default" is a special argument that specifies the initial return
    # value of the component before the user has interacted with it., selectColIndex=-1, selectRowIndex=-1
    component_value = _component_func(data=data, title=None, default=False)

    # We could modify the value returned from the component if we wanted.
    # There's no need to do this in our simple example - but it's an option.
